# ForkNote API

A simple backend CRUD using ExpressJS (with TypeScript) + MongoDB. This is a practice / side project that I have created by following a NodeJS course from Udemy. Although the course used the same code base for the frontend, I decided to make it a separate repo and I will use ReactJS.

## Setup

- Create a folder called `images` inside the `uploads` directory
- Inside the `images` folder, create two more called `recipes` and `users`.
- Proceed with the usual NPM commands:

```bash
# use the specified node version on nvmrc, so you need nvm to be installed or you can check the .nvmrc file for the version so we have the same versions.
nvm use

# install all the dependencies
npm install

# build the project
npm run build

# start the project
npm run start
```
